# Unsupervised Learning 

I have another project, [Birdnet-Edge](https://github.com/electricdarb/Birdnet-Edge), that collects a ridiculous amount of data. It is in the range of 10s of thousands to hundreds of thousands of images a day. To deal with this data I need to add an unsupervised aspect since I can't possibly have someone label all this data. Hence, I need to cluster each image. 

The clustering is done in two parts. First, the images are trained using NCE loss with which pushes vectors of similar images together and different images apart. Check [this blog](https://sthalles.github.io/simple-self-supervised-learning/) out for more info. Second, the learned vectors for each image are clustered together by [Kmeans](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html). Now I have groups of similar images together, so rather than labeling one image at a time, I can label one image from each cluster. This makes labeling significantly more effective.
